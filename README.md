###I am a 4th year Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. I have hopes of combining Mechanical and Software engineering to create solutions for problems we face in todays world. I am particularly intrested in Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning. Currently, I am working on my Thesis involving Machine Learning, Satellite Data, and Healthcare.
